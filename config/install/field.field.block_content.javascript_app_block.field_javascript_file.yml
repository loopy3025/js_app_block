description: 'Use this field to indicate the location of your Javascript file. This location can be relative to the site's domain. This file will be included as a page attachment wherever the block appears in your site. We suggest using location on your site that will be included in your codebase as the home for your Javascript. Be careful about adding large libraries with this method. Note that the files folder may be purged of scripts from time to time by Drupal, so you''ll want to avoid that as well.'
